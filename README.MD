In order to run the program, you need to write in the terminal: cd project/src, and then ruby app.rb.
In order to log in on the website, we have the following details: if you wish to log in as an admin, the username and password are both 
"admin"; if you wish to log in as a normal user, the username and password are both "user". 
If you're not logged in, you can only see the bookmarks and search for a particular bookmark. In order to comment, rate, edit, report or make
a bookmark a favourite, you need to be logged in as an user. If you're not an user, you can simply click on the Sign Up and create an account
which then needs to be approved by an admin. 
As an admin, you can manage the accounts, either approve new accounts or delete them, as well as make an account an admin, and manage the
bookmark reports.
